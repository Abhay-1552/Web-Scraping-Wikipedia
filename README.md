# Web Scrapping-Wikipedia

The code utilizes Beautiful Soup, a Python library, to extract information from Wikipedia pages by parsing HTML.

Flask, a lightweight web application framework, is employed to create a user-friendly interface for displaying the scraped data.

Users can interact with the application by searching for specific topics, exploring random articles, and customizing the display format.

Real-time updates ensure that the displayed content remains current, offering a seamless and dynamic exploration of Wikipedia's wealth of information.

The code essentially combines the power of Beautiful Soup for web scraping and Flask for web application development to provide an engaging and responsive platform for navigating and interacting with Wikipedia content
